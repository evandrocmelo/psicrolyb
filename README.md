# PsychroLib - A Library of Psychrometric Functions in C, Fortran, VBA (Excel), JavaScript, and Python
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/psychrometrics/psychrolib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/psychrometrics/psychrolib)

Psychrometrics are the study of physical and thermodynamic properties of moist air. These properties include, for example, the air's dew point temperature, its wet bulb temperature, relative humidity, humidity ratio, enthalpy.

PsychroLib is a library of functions to enable calculating psychrometric properties of moist and dry air. The library is available for Python, C, Fortran, JavaScript, and Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). The functions are based of formulae from the  2017 ASHRAE Handbook — Fundamentals, Chapter 1. Functions can be grouped into two categories:

1. Functions for the calculation of dew point temperature,
    wet-bulb temperature, partial vapour pressure of water, humidity
    ratio or relative humidity, knowing any other of these and dry bulb
    temperature and atmospheric pressure;

2. Functions for the calculation of other moist air properties. All these use the
    humidity ratio as input.

Relationships between these various functions are illustrated in Figure 1. To compute a moist air property such as enthalpy, knowing a humidity parameter such as dew point temperature, one first has to compute the humidity ratio from the dew point temperature, then compute the enthalpy from the humidity ratio. The functions in point (1) above include primary relationships corresponding to formulae from the ASHRAE Handbook, and secondary relationships which use a combination of primary relationships to calculate the result. For example, to compute dew point temperature knowing the partial pressure of water vapor in moist air, the library uses a formula from the ASHRAE Handbook (primary relationship). On the other hand to compute dew point temperature from relative humidity, the library first computes the partial pressure of water vapor, then computes the dew point temperature (secondary relationship). Primary relationships are shown with bold double arrows in Figure 1.

## Getting started
PsychroLib is available for Python, C, Fortran, JavaScript, and Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). A list of functions available in the library can be found in the [PsychroLib application programming interface (API) documentation](https://psychrometrics.github.io/psychrolib). The page provides a comprehensive description of all the functions available in PsychroLib. Although it describes the Python version of the library, PsychroLib uses a common API across all the supported language implementations.

### Installation instructions
If you are using Python, PsychroLib is available though the Python Package Index (PyPI) at https://pypi.org/project/PsychroLib. Assuming you have PyPI installed on your system, type the following in your command prompt:
```
pip install psychrolib
```

For all other languages, clone the repository or download the file directly from the repository, and include PsychroLib to your code according to the language specifications.

### Example usage
For examples on how to use PsychroLib in Python, C, Fortran, JavaScript, and Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) please see [this guide](docs/how-to-use-psychrolib.md).
