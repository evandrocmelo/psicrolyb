2.1.2
- Fix coefficient in `dLnPws_` (2 -> 3 -- 1st order derivative T^3 in GetSatVapPres; #40).

2.1.1
- Use of triple point of water in GetSatVapPres (#36).

2.1.0
- Add functions to convert between specific humidity and humidity ratio (aka mixing ratio).
- Add functions to convert to dry bulb temperature or humidity ratio from enthalpy.
- Restrict minimum value of humidity ratio to `1e-7`
- Fix bug with `GetTDewPointFromVapPres` not always converging due to discontinuity about the freezing point of water in `GetSatVapPres` formulae.
- General `README.md`/docs improvements.
